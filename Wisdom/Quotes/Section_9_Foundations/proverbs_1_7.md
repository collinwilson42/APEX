# Quote

"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction."

## Context

This opens the Book of Proverbs, setting the stage for all wisdom that follows. Solomon contrasts two paths: those who seek wisdom through humility, and fools who reject instruction. The word 'fool' here doesn't mean lacking intelligence, but rather someone who rejects wisdom due to pride or stubbornness.

## Notes

In trading: The 'fools' are those who refuse to learn from losses, ignore risk management, and think they're smarter than the market. True knowledge starts with acknowledging what you don't know.
