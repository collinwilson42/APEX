# Principle: Foundational Humility

True wisdom requires foundational respect and humility. Overconfidence and hubris block the path to genuine understanding.

## Core Insight

You cannot gain wisdom while believing you already possess it completely. The acknowledgment of limitation and the respect for forces greater than yourself creates the openness necessary for learning.

## Universal Applications

- In learning: Acknowledge what you don't know
- In relationships: Respect others' expertise
- In business: Stay humble despite success
- In trading: Respect the market's power
