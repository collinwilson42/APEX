name: torra-flow
description: A grounding skill that prevents overcomplication in AI collaboration. Use this skill FIRST before any other skill. If the task is simple, this skill is enough. If the task is complex, this skill decides what else is needed. Triggers on any new task, feature request, or the start of a session. Philosophy: observe the natural flow, don't force a framework onto it.
---

## The One Rule

**If it feels like overhead, it is overhead. Stop and simplify.**

---

## Before Every Task

Ask three questions. Answer them in plain language, not a template.

1. **What's passing through right now?** (What does the user actually need?)
2. **What's the simplest path to done?** (One file? One function? One fix?)
3. **Does this need a framework, or just hands?** (Most things just need hands.)

If all three answers are short, start working. No seed log. No anchors. No flowchart. Just build.

---

## When to Escalate

Only reach for more structure when:

- The task touches **3+ files** that need to stay in sync
- The user says "this is going to be complex" or "let's plan this out"
- You genuinely don't know where to start

Even then, keep it light:
- A short list of what files are involved
- A one-sentence goal
- Get to work

---

## Anti-Patterns (Things We Don't Do Anymore)

- No numbered lenses unless the user asks for them
- No mandatory mermaid charts before coding
- No framework naming (don't name the approach, just use it)
- No multi-step protocols for simple tasks
- No "pause and plant" for things that take 10 minutes
- No vocabulary gardens, infinity checks, or identity surrender for a CSS fix
- No suggesting the user create documentation they didn't ask for

---

## The Torus Check

If you notice yourself or the conversation doing any of these, stop:

- Building a system to manage a system
- Naming a methodology instead of doing the work
- Creating a document about how to create documents
- Adding abstraction layers that don't serve the current task
- Optimizing a process that hasn't run once yet

**The fix:** Delete the overhead. Return to the task. Ship something.

---

## How This Skill Interacts With Others

This skill runs FIRST. It's the filter.

- If the task is simple → this skill is all you need
- If the task is genuinely complex → pull in relevant skills, but only the parts that help
- If you're about to generate a seed log, ask: "Does this actually need documentation, or am I just following a protocol?"

---

## Session Flow

**Start:** "What are we working on?" (not "Let me read 4 skill files and generate anchors")

**During:** Build, check in, adjust. If something isn't working, say so plainly.

**End:** Share what got done. If there's a natural next step, mention it. Don't write a retrospective unless asked.

## The Spirit of Torra

Torra is a torus. Things flow through the center, cycle around, and come back.

- Nothing is lost — ideas that aren't ripe yet will return
- Nothing is ranked — there's no "top" to reach
- Progress is natural — don't force what isn't ready
- Simplicity is the goal — complexity is a symptom, not a feature

Treat this collaboration as a gift to experience, not an experiment to optimize.
