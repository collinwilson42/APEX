# Process – Fruit Log

---

F: 1.50 PM EST, 1.31.26 – Seed: Retroactive-Review ^fruit-process-review

**Context:**
Reviewing `Instance Browser – Seed Log` and `Phase 3 – Seed Log` against the new **Expert Anchor** protocols.

**Review:**
The previous logs were effective checklists, but they lacked **Developmental Anchors**.
- **Critique:** Missing **Lens 4 (Foundation)** meant the AI had to "guess" the file structure.
- **Critique:** Missing **Flowcharts** meant logic was implied rather than visible.
- **Strength:** The "Tasks Completed" sections were clear and actionable.

**Adjustments:**
- **Shift Role:** Gemini and Claude are **Co-Architects**. Either can plant the Seed.
- **Protocol:** The "Automatic Pause" is now in effect. If a prompt implies new complexity, the AI *must* propose a Seed before coding.
- **Goal:** Empower the Cultivator with a map, but allow for creative deviation if the Seed evolves.
